# Wander
Local Tour Guides on your own time

## Basic Features to Come

We are thinking essentially a modified version of an Uber experience. We boiled down this to these *essential* features

- Map landing page showing local tour guides' locations / distances
- Ability to make a request with the following attributes:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Time Estimate
- Local Tour Guides can evaluate the request and either accept or reject
- Ability to rate / comment on tour once it is over.

## For Now:

Change your `/etc/hosts` file to include this line because someone else owns the domain we want:

```
127.0.0.1   wander.com
```
